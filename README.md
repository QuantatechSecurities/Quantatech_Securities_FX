## MA Strategy
The **MA Strategy** uses moving averages to calculate short and long buy positions. The model automatically calculates the lot size of the order and  continuously recalculates the stop-loss of the position based on price movement.

## MACD Strategy
 The **MACD Strategy** uses MACD signals and price momentum to calculate short and long positions. The model automatically calculates the lot size of the order and  continuously recalculates the stop-loss of the position based on price movement.
 
 ## How to run
 The models can be run in the _Metatrader_ environment for automated trading. Before running, the models need to be compiled.
